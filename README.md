# Deep_Dream
In this project, I explore the Deep Dream algorithm to accentuate and expand upon the features within a monkey's image as detected by the pre-trained VGG16 and DenseNet121 models. After the initial feature enhancement, I guide the transformation by introducing images of a banana and cherry.
